kinetic
=====

Kinetic is a handy tool that you can use to upload your code to remote sources.

The name "kinetic" was inspired from the physical sense, where something moves from one place to another.

## Modular

This project was built with modularity in mind.

PasteBin, is just one of the many potential use cases for this package.

This package is potentially useful for private use.  By creating a module named myapp.coffee and following the [API (will link soon)](#),
you are able to specify your own local url to share code with coworkers, or potentially even live changes.
