PasteBin, is just one of the many potential use cases for this package.

This package is potentially useful for private use.  By creating a module named `myapp.coffee` and following the [API](https://github.com/ddavison/kinetic/wiki/API),
you are able to specify your own local url to share code with coworkers, or potentially even share live changes.
